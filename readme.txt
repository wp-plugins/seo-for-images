People love images and video, but search engines are designed for text.  The more information you give us about your images and video, the better. In general, follow these guidelines:
<ul>

<li>Create great alt text and title text. Alt text is used to describe the contents of an image file. It is great for human readers, but it also provides search engines with useful information about the target image or video.</li>

<li>Give your images and video context. Google can infer a great deal about your image or video from the content surrounding it. For example, a picture of a guitar on a page about the history of guitars sends a strong signal to search engines that black-fender-guitar.jpg is about guitars.</li>

<li>Provide a great user experience. Try not to make users scroll to see your images and video, and use high-quality source files.</li>
</ul>
