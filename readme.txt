<b>How to improve you image seo for Google:</b>
People love images and video, but search engines are designed for text.  The more information you give us about your images and video, the better. In general, follow these guidelines:
<ul>


<li>Use descriptive file names. The file name black-fender-guitar.jpg tells us a lot more than image1.jpg. </li>

<li>Create great alt text and title text. Alt text is used to describe the contents of an image file. It¡¯s great for human readers, but it also provides search engines with useful information about the target image or video.</li>

<li>Give your images and video context. Google can infer a great deal about your image or video from the content surrounding it. For example, a picture of a guitar on a page about the history of guitars sends a strong signal to search engines that black-fender-guitar.jpg is about guitars.</li>

<li>Provide a great user experience. Try not to make users scroll to see your images and video, and use high-quality source files.</li>
</ul>
